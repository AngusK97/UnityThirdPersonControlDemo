# Unity Third Person Control Demo
A third person control demo inspired by the Witcher 3. 
From a third person perspective, player can control a character in the scene to walk, run, jump, do combo attack, move on slop, and fall.

This demo is implemented by Angus Kung to practice Rigidbody, IK, Input System, Cinemachine and Animator in Unity.

For the next version, scripts will be refactored into a clearer and more flexible sturcture. 
In the future, this project will not only be about third person control and may add more features, including enemy AI, dialog system, better game scene.
